# Youtube-Recommendation-System-
A Machine Learning-based recommendation engine that mimics YouTubeâ€™s video recommendation algorithm. This project analyzes video metadata (title, tags, views, likes, categories, etc.) from the Kaggle YouTube dataset (INvideos.csv) to suggest relevant videos using content-based filtering, NLP, and similarity models.
